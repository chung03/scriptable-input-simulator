This program is used for scripting input simulation and repeating it as many times as you would like.

The program works by reading a script file and then executing the commands in the file. Badly formatted lines are omitted.

The files are formatted in the following way:

COMMAND: <PARAMETERS>


The following commands are accepted:

key_sequence: <letters_to_type>
    - The program will type the letters specified in <letters_to_type>

key: <letter_key> <button_action>
    - The program will do the <button_action> with the <key> button on your keyboard
    - <button_action> can be one of the following:
        - press
            - This action is the same as pushing the button down on your keyboard

        - release
            - This action is the same as releasing a pushed button on your keyboard

        - click
            - click is equivalent to pressing and then releasing soon after

wait: <amount_of_milliseconds>
    - The program will do nothing for <amount_of_milliseconds> milliseconds

mouse_click: <mouse_button>
    - Clicks <mouse_button> at its current location
    - <mouse_button> can be one of the following:
        - left
        - right
        - middle

mouse_down: <mouse_button>
    - Presses and holds <mouse_button> at its current location
    - <mouse_button> can be one of the following:
        - left
        - right
        - middle

mouse_release: <mouse_button>
    - Releases <mouse_button> at its current location
    - <mouse_button> can be one of the following:
        - left
        - right
        - middle

mouse_move: <mouse_x> <mouse_y>
    - Moves the mouse cursor to the point specified on the screen
    - Where the mouse moves is determined by the resolution of the screen. Please check your screen resolution when using this command
        - <mouse_x> should be between 0 and the horizontal resolution of your screen
            - 0 is left. Higher numbers are right

        - <mouse_y> should be between 0 and the vertical resolution of your screen
            - 0 is up. Higher numbers are down

screen_compare_key_click: <key> <start_x> <start_y> <screen_capture_width> <screen_capture_height> <match_threshold> <image_file_path>
    - The program will compare an area of the screen to the image at <image_file_path>
    - The compare area is a rectangle with width <screen_capture_width> and height <screen_capture_height>. The top left corner is at <start_x> <start_y>
    - The image comparison is done pixel-by-pixel. This means that if the screen compare area is off by a pixel or more, you will match less than expected
    - If the images share at least <match_threshold>% pixels, then the program will click <key>


Example of a file that moves a mouse to a location on the screen, clicks, then pressed a and then tabs and then presses b:

mouse_move: 500 500
wait: 100
mouse_click: left
wait: 100
layout_key: a click
wait: 100
function_key: tab click
wait: 100
layout_key: b click

Usage: auto_clicker.exe [OPTIONS] --file_name <file>

Options:
  -f, --file_name <file>
  -s, --start_delay <start_delay_ms>                           The program will wait this long before executing the commands. This is in milliseconds [default: 0]
  -t, --times_to_execute_commands <times_to_execute_commands>  [default: 1]
  -h, --help                                                   Print help (see more with '--help')
  -V, --version                                                Print version

The file name option is required.


Example usage:

autoclicker.exe --file_name fishing_automation.txt -t 9999999
    - This program reads the script file fishing_automation.txt and repeats the commands 9999999 times
