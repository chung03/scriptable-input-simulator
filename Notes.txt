- It seems that these two Rust packages are good for doing clicks and listening to input:
	enigo
		https://github.com/enigo-rs/enigo
			- This one is also being updated regularly

	inputbot

- There's also a reddit thread too about options:
	https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/aaft23/rust_equivalent_of_javas_robot_api/


- I'll use inputbot to start with, since it's the most recently updated one I found
	https://github.com/obv-mikhail/inputbot

	- This may not suit my particular needs, actually.

- There's actually a few ways to do an auto scripted robot:
	- As soon as the program starts, read a file and then do stuff based on the file
		- Optionally repeat some amount of times or until a specific key

	- As soon as the program starts, read a file to figure out the key press sequence
		- Once a specific key is pressed, then execute the key press sequence which was read earlier
			- Could be executed once
			- Could be executed as long as the key is held
			- Could be executed forever until I press the key again

- I'll be doing a lot of string parsing. This page is going to be very relevant:
	https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings

- I'm getting some bugs when I try to simulate key presses in enigo related to transmute_copy()
	- These people have the same kind of issue:
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74882452/thread-panicking-when-simulating-keypresses-in-using-enigo

		- It looks like I'll have to patch to the latest checkin of enigo
			https://github.com/enigo-rs/enigo/issues/121

			- I put my cloned copy here:
				D:\Rust_Downloaded_GitHub\enigo
	
	- The other option is to find another library entirely to use

- To make a static hashmap, I can use crates like the following:
	https://docs.rs/lazy_static/1.4.0/lazy_static/
	https://docs.rs/phf/latest/phf/

	- It seems phf does exactly what I need
		https://crates.io/crates/phf


- For command line argument parsing, I'll just use clap
	- https://github.com/clap-rs/clap

	- Tutorials:
		https://blog.logrocket.com/command-line-argument-parsing-rust-using-clap/

	- I'll use the Derive stuff for now.
