- It seems that these two Rust packages are good for doing clicks and listening to input:
	enigo
		https://github.com/enigo-rs/enigo
			- This one is also being updated regularly

	inputbot

- There's also a reddit thread too about options:
	https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/aaft23/rust_equivalent_of_javas_robot_api/


- I'll use inputbot to start with, since it's the most recently updated one I found
	https://github.com/obv-mikhail/inputbot

	- This may not suit my particular needs, actually.

- There's actually a few ways to do an auto scripted robot:
	- As soon as the program starts, read a file and then do stuff based on the file
		- Optionally repeat some amount of times or until a specific key

	- As soon as the program starts, read a file to figure out the key press sequence
		- Once a specific key is pressed, then execute the key press sequence which was read earlier
			- Could be executed once
			- Could be executed as long as the key is held
			- Could be executed forever until I press the key again

- I'll be doing a lot of string parsing. This page is going to be very relevant:
